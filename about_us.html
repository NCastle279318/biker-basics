                <p class="para-custom">Created at the turn of the Century by avid motorcyclist and former Traffic Officer, Lloyd Castle, the goal of the Academy is to provide motorcycle rider training in the form of Basic to Advanced level motorcycle handling and survival skills,
                    of the kind employed by motorcycle police officers the world over, to the ever growing civilian motorcycle population.</p>
                <p class="para-custom">The Academy opened its doors to its first civilian student rider back in 2001, prior to which these skills were exclusively taught to traffic and police motorcyclists and it has now trained literally thousands of riders since.</p>
                <p class="para-custom">We have taught rider survival skills to riders who now enjoy motorcycling with the reduced risk that rider competence developed through proper training and practice allows.</p>

                <h2 class="headings1"><strong>OUR MOTIVATION</strong></h2>
                <p class="para-custom">First hand experience of the carnage caused by untrained and ill-prepared riders gained from almost two decades of attending to collision scenes made it clear that law enforcement alone would not reduce the needless suffering.</p>
                <p class="para-custom">It was clear that until formal motorcycle training was introduced to the general motorcycling population, many more would fall victim to their own lack of skill and inexperience.</p>
                <p class="para-custom">The Academy was founded on meeting this need for structured formal motorcycle training and set out to provide the training required for survival.</p>
